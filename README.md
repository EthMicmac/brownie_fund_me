# brownie_fund_me

This Smart Contract Application is designed to provide an easy way to fund a project.
The Application accepts financing from different sources - much like kickstarter.
The creator of the fund project is the only able to take out any of the deposited funding.
Since it runs on the blockchain, there is no third-party capable of preventing the deposited funds from reaching the intended party (owner).
This project uses Python (brownie) and Solidity.
